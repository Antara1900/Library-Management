# Library Management
## Project Overview
-- This project simulates a Library Management System using SQL. It includes 6 datasets (tables) and demonstrates how to query them to answer 20+ real-world business questions.

## The goal is to showcase:

--Strong knowledge of SQL concepts (Joins, Grouping, Aggregation, Subqueries, Window Functions).

-- Ability to design and work with relational databases.

-- Problem-solving skills using real-world scenarios like overdue books, fines, and borrowing trends.

## Datasets
--The project uses 6 core datasets:

1. Authors – Stores author details.

2. Books – Book information linked to authors and categories.

3. Members – Registered library members.

4. Borrow_Records – Tracks borrowing activity (borrow date, return date, due date).

5. Fines – Fine details for late returns.

6. Categories – Different book categories.


## Analytical Use-Cases Covered

1. List all books with their author names 
--Helps in understanding the author-book relationship for cataloging and recommendations.

2. Find members who joined in 2025 
--Useful for member growth tracking and onboarding analysis.

3. Count books per category 
--Shows category popularity and helps in inventory planning.

4. Top 5 most borrowed books 
--Identifies reader preferences and demand trends.

5. Overdue books not returned 
--Supports library operations by tracking pending returns.

6. Members with >10 borrows 
--Detects highly engaged members (loyal readers).

7. Members borrowing from ≥3 categories 
--Indicates diverse reading interests.

8. Top 3 most borrowed authors
-- Highlights author popularity for collection strategy.

9. Books never borrowed 
-- Identifies underutilized resources (low-demand books).

10. Members who returned all books 
--Finds responsible members (good borrowing behavior).

11. Borrows per category (last 90 days) 
--Shows recent borrowing trends.

12. Total fines per member 
--Tracks monetary impact and frequent defaulters.

13. Books borrowed more than average 
-- Reveals best-performing books.

14. Members with latest borrow date
--Helps identify active users.

15. Monthly borrow trend (last 6 months) 
--Analyzes seasonal/temporal borrowing patterns.

16. Rank members by total fines
--Profiles top defaulters for policy decisions.

17. Books borrowed & returned same day
-- Detects short-term usage (e.g., reference books).

18. Most popular borrowing day of week
--Supports operational planning (staffing & open hours).

19. Members borrowing in consecutive months
-- Identifies consistent readers.

20. Late return percentage per category
-- Helps in policy enforcement by category.

## Conclusion:
Each of the 20 SQL queries in this project is designed not just to answer a technical question, but to simulate real-world analytical needs of a library system.
From identifying popular authors and categories, to tracking borrowing trends, overdue fines, and member engagement, these queries demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights.

-- This project highlights my ability to:

Understand business requirements and translate them into SQL solutions.

Apply both basic (joins, filters, grouping) and advanced (CTEs, window functions, ranking) SQL techniques.

Deliver insights that support decision making and operations analysis.
